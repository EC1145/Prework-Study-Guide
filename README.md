# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

My motivation was to learn more about HTML and creat a basit webpage I did this, to improve on my basic skills in programming. This also solves the problem of where to put my notes in for the course. I learned how to code in HTML, how to style using CSS, and how to add and make a function using JavaScript. Also for and if loops.
